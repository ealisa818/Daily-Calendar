# Daily-Calendar

This is a calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

For this web application, I have used:

  * Bootstrap
  * JQuery
  * moment.js
  * CSS

Usage

  * When the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
  * When I scroll down, there are time blocks for standard business hours.
  * The time blocks are color coded to indicate whether they are in the past, present and future.
  * Events can be entered into each time block.
  * When the save button is clicked, the event is saved in local storage.
